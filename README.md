  - **Analytics Dashboard:** Charts (audits over time, issues by type/severity).

- **Firebase:**
  - Aggregate data using **Firestore queries** or **Cloud Functions** for heavy analysis.
  - Store generated reports as files in Cloud Storage if needed.

---

## 7. **Template & Checklist Management**
- **Screens:**
  - **Templates List:** CRUD for templates (Admin only).
  - **Template Editor:** Add/edit sections, checklist items, scoring, required photo.

## 9. **Notifications**
- **In-app:**
  - Local notifications (Flutter Local Notifications).
  - List of notifications in-app (from `notifications` collection).

- **Push:**
  - **Firebase Cloud Messaging** for real-time alerts (upcoming audits, new issues, assignments).

---

## 10. **Settings**
- **Screens:**
  - **User Preferences:** Notification settings, language, theme.
  - **App Settings:** Audit frequency, export options.

---

## **Additional Features**
- **Camera Integration:** Use Flutter plugins to capture and upload photos as evidence.
- **Offline Mode:** Use local cache (e.g., Hive/SQLite) to store checklists/results until online.
- **Digital Signatures:** Use a signature pad widget, store as image in Cloud Storage.

    name, email, role, profilePhotoUrl, ...
locations/
  {locationId}/
    name, address, ...
audits/
  {auditId}/
    type, date, locationId, auditorId, templateId, status, ...
    results/
      {resultId}/
        sectionId, itemId, value, comment, photoUrl, ...
issues/
  {issueId}/
    auditId, itemId, description, severity, status, assignedTo, dueDate, evidenceUrls, comments[]
checklists/
  {templateId}/
    name, assignedTo, sections: [
      { sectionId, name, items: [{ itemId, description, score, requirePhoto }] }
    ]
notifications/
  {notificationId}/
    userId, message, type, relatedAuditId, read
```

# **Productive Implementation Steps**

1. **Setup Firebase Project:** Enable Auth, Firestore, Storage, FCM.
2. **Initialize Flutter Project:** Add firebase_core, firebase_auth, cloud_firestore, firebase_storage, firebase_messaging, provider, and other needed packages.
3. **Design UI Wireframes:** Use Figma/Adobe XD or Flutter’s WidgetBook for prototyping.
4. **Implement Authentication:** Email/password + Google sign-in; store roles in Firestore.
5. **Build Core Flows:**
    - Dashboard
    - Audit list/scheduling
    - Audit execution (dynamic checklists, photo upload)
    - Issue tracking
    - Reports/analytics
6. **Admin Features:** Template, staff, and location management.
7. **Notifications:** Integrate FCM and local notifications.
8. **Security:** Set up Firestore Rules for role-based access.
9. **Testing:** Widget, integration, and manual testing.
10. **Deployment:** Play Store/TestFlight; set up crash/error monitoring (Firebase Crashlytics).

---

# **Sample User Journey**
1. **Admin** creates audit templates and adds staff/locations.
2. **Admin** schedules audits and assigns them to auditors.
3. **Auditor** logs in, completes checklist (with comments/photos).
4. **Issues** are auto-flagged; assigned to staff for resolution.
5. **Manager/Admin** reviews reports and compliance analytics.
